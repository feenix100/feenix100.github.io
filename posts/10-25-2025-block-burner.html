        <h2 class="subsection-title">Block Burner - a multiplayer game</h2>

<p>      
Block Burner is an exciting multiplayer game that challenges players to strategically place blocks and clear them with the goal of overloading your opponent's grid. The game combines elements of strategy, quick thinking, and teamwork, making it a thrilling experience for players of all ages. This game was inspired by a classic game called Yahoo Towers.
</p>

<h2 class="subsection-title">The official web site</h2>
<p>
    Check it out at <a href="https://blockburner.itch.io/blockburner">Block Burner on itch.io!</a>
</p>

<p>
In Block Burner, players take turns placing blocks on a grid, aiming to create patterns that will allow them to burn their blocks and score points. The game requires players to think ahead, anticipate their opponents' moves, and adapt their strategies on the fly. With its simple yet engaging mechanics, Block Burner is easy to learn but difficult to master.
</p>

<p>
Block Burner offers a fresh take on multiplayer gaming by combining strategic depth with fast-paced action. Players must balance offensive and defensive moves, collaborate with teammates, and outwit their opponents to claim victory. The game's dynamic gameplay and vibrant visuals make it a captivating experience for casual and competitive players alike.
</p>

<p>
    At the moment, the game is only a 2 player or 1 player vs CPU experience, but I plan to expand it to support more players in the future. It will support 2 to 8 players. Users will be able to create their own table and play against their friends or dominate random players from around the world.
